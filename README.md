# NanoGPT

---

This was a side project I did over the summer. I took inspiration from Andrej Karpathy to create my own character level GPT.

There are custom coded multi-headed attention blocks, layer norms, a Bigram-Style Embedder with individual character level tokens. There are also some other miscellaneous files around here as well

The ```final.txt``` contains the nanoGPT's attempt to complete the wiki documents based on the short excerpts from simple_wiki.txt.
